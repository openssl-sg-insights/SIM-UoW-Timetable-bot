# Special thanks
Authors of all libraries / modules used in the development of this bot, in no particular order:
* [Python Telegram Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) - the most readable framework for the telegram bot API .
* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - best HTML parser
* [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) - making headless navigation easy
* [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) - Chromedriver and chromium authors.
* [SIMConnect](https://simconnect.simge.edu.sg/) - For not providing native API methods and requiring me to write this shitty mess of code to get a painless way of recording and checking my timetable.
* My users, for never reporting errors and often making things harder to debug than necessary.
* Anybody else I missed
